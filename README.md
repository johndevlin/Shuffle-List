* Non-hammer branch is not up to date with Master



Uh?

Trigger is a lightweight HTML5 template made to use with [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/).

It's based on [the HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), with some of the guff stripped out, and some [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Bourbon Mixins](http://bourbon.io/), [Bourbon Neat grid](http://neat.bourbon.io/) & some JavaScript I regularly us, added in.



JavaScript
----------

I've added in a lot of regularly used jQuery to scripts.js. 

* Date injection - For the footer's copyright
* [jQuery Smartresize](https://github.com/louisremi/jquery-smartresize) - Debounced resize events for jQuery
* ESC Key listener
* Sticky content after scroll
* Form validation
* Smooth scroll

These should be removed if not needed, think of all those sweet, sweet Kb you're saving yo'.



No Hammer?
----------

If [Hammer](http://hammerformac.com/) isn't your thing, I've branched off [a non-hammer version of the template](https://github.com/johndevlin/Trigger/tree/no_hammer). 



To-dos
------

This is (and probably always will be) a work in progress. Here are some features I'll be adding in.

* Nothing
